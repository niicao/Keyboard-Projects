This is an alice-layout case made of stacked acrylic.

-The spacers used are M3 15mm long with 3/16" diameter.

The main goal of this project was to make an affordable alice-layout case so the Brazilian Community could test the layout before spending a lot in a aluminum case and running the risk of not being able to get used to the layout.
A small GB ran in mid-July ~ early-August with 8 units being sold and no-profit on my end (20 BRL of profit for each case, less than 4 USD per piece at the time).
This was my first take in designing a keyboard, it isn't even close to what I feel is a good keyboard but it managed to complete its goal.
