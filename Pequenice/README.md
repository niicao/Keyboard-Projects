### An alice-layout keyboard case made of stacked acrylic layers.
 Case Specs:
* Sandwich Mount
* Supports both top and bottom USB PCB's
* TGR Alice standard layout
* The plate is designed to be 1.5mm.
* The spacers used are M3 15mm long with 3/16" diameter.

The main goal of this project was to make an affordable alice-layout case so the Brazilian Community could test the layout before spending a lot in a aluminum case and running the risk of not being able to get used to the layout.
A small GB ran in mid-July ~ early-August with 8 units being sold and no-profit on my end (20 BRL of profit for each case, less than 4 USD per piece at the time).
This was my first take in designing a keyboard, it isn't even close to what I feel is a good keyboard but it managed to complete its goal.

### My honest review
For the price, this is a pretty decent keyboard, with a very nice sound profile, in my opinion. I do like the design myself but my main complain in this keyboard is the high front height, it is possible to remove one mid-layer but I still feel that it's too high for me. It's not a bad experience at all, I used it as a daily for quite some time and this was my first alice-like and nowadays alice-layout are my favorite keyboard layouts.
